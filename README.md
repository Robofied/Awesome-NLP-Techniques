Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics), [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), and [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of [natural language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language) data. The result is a computer capable of "understanding" the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.

Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition), [natural language understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_understanding), and [natural-language generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_generation).
